### Manual Installation (For WebKit-Based Browsers)

If you are using another WebKit-based browser or application, you can manually install the Eyed Blocklist by following these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the blocklist.
2. Follow the instructions specific to your browser or application for importing custom blocklists.
3. Ensure that the blocklist is active and configured correctly within your browser's settings.

## Blocklist Format

The Eyed Blocklist is provided in a JSON format that is compatible with WebKit-based browsers. The blocklist entries are structured to specify the elements, domains, and scripts that need to be blocked. Hereâ€™s a simplified example of the structure:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "url-filter": ".*",
    "resource-type": ["image", "script", "stylesheet"]
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "block"
  }
}
```

- **trigger**: Defines the conditions under which the block action should be applied. This could include specific URL patterns, resource types, or other conditions.
  
- **action**: Specifies the action to be taken when the trigger conditions are met. In most cases, this will be a "block" action to prevent the resource from loading.

For more details on the structure and how to customize the blocklist, refer to the [WebKit Content Blocker Documentation](https://webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/).
